it's a python-based web scraper to extract structured data from IMDb’s Top 250 Movies page. The project fetches live HTML content, parses it and collects key movie attributes such as title, release year, and IMDb rating. The extracted data is cleaned, structured using Pandas, and exported into a CSV file for further analysis or visualization.
